# Trip Planning Web App

## Description

This is a web application that generates a personalized travel plan for a city based on the user's input. The app uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model to generate a unique travel plan by time, taking into account the current weather in the city.

## Dependencies

This application requires the following dependencies:

- express
- body-parser
- axios
- dotenv
- ejs
- @openai/api

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

``` bash
npm install express body-parser axios dotenv ejs openai
```


## Usage

To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using the command above.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key and weather API key in the following format:

``` javascript

OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```


4. Run the server by running `node app.js` in your terminal.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
6. Enter the name of the city you want to explore and submit the form.
7. Wait for a few moments for the app to generate your personalized travel plan.
8. Enjoy your trip!

## Code Structure

The app is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework. The main file is `app.js`, which handles the server-side logic for the app. The `views` directory contains the EJS template files for the app's frontend.

## Limitations

Please note that this app is not perfect and may not always generate an accurate travel plan. The plan generated by the app is based on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model, which may not always be able to understand the user's input correctly or generate an optimal travel plan. Additionally, the app relies on the accuracy of the weather API to provide up-to-date weather information for the city.
